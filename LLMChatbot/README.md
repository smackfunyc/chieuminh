Overview

This project utilizes the LangGraph library to create an interactive chat application that generates responses based on predefined constants and user input. It integrates various Python libraries, such as gradio for user interface, langchain_openai for leveraging OpenAI's language models, and pydantic for data validation. The application defines a stateful graph structure where nodes represent Python functions that handle user interactions and produce random or AI-generated responses. The core functionality includes defining a state representation, building a response graph, and launching a chat interface, allowing users to engage with the application seamlessly while demonstrating the power of combining Python functions with language models.
