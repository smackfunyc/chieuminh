# **Director of Product Design: Celigo, EverydayHealth, Citigroup**

Welcome to the **Product Design ** folder! As a **Director of Product Design**, 
I’ve steered teams through the wild jungle of complex, data-heavy products in
**Data Integration**, **Observability**, **API Builder**, **Automation**, and **EDI (Electronic Data Interchange)**. 
This folder is a showcase of the work I’ve led, from crafting a crystal-clear vision to herding cross-functional teams 
toward success without anyone getting lost in the data swamp.

## 🌟 **About This Folder**

This folder captures the chaos and triumph of building user-focused, data-intensive products. I’ve led teams to create solutions that make data sing, automation hum, and APIs play nice. Each project started with a **bold vision and charter** for the product design team, followed by tight collaboration with **product**, **engineering**, and **marketing** teams to deliver tools that users love and businesses rely on.

Here’s what you’ll find:
- **Stratgey Documents**: Charters and Vision that kept our teams aligned, even when the data got messy.
- **Case Studies**: Stories of how we tackled challenges and delivered value.
- **Design Artifacts**: Wireframes, prototypes, and user flows that shaped our products.

## 💡 **What’s Inside**

- **🛠️ AI**: AI integrated throughout the platform in the form of Co-pilot for automations and code blocks.
- **🛠️ Data Integration**: Systems that unify scattered data sources into seamless workflows, making chaos look like a symphony.
- **🔍 Observability**: Tools that give teams X-ray vision into system performance, catching issues before they explode.
- **🔗 API Builder**: Platforms for crafting APIs that connect apps like a digital handshake.
- **⚙️ Automation**: Solutions that take repetitive tasks and send them packing, freeing up human brainpower.
- **📡 EDI**: Streamlined electronic data exchange systems that keep business transactions humming.

Each artifact reflects deep collaboration, rigorous iteration, and a relentless focus on user needs—without tripping over any cables.

## 🏗️ **How to Explore**

1. **Browse the Artifacts**: Dive into case studies. Each has notes explaining the context and impact.
2. **Read the Charters**: Check out vision documents to see how I set the stage for success.
3. **Connect the Dots**: Cross-reference with my [X Scraper](https://github.com/smackfunyc/chieuminh/tree/main/x_scraper) project,
4. a data-scraping script that vibes with the data integration theme here.

### Example Deliverable
- **Observability Dashboard Prototype**: A clickable prototype for a monitoring tool that lets teams spot system hiccups in real-time, born from late-night brainstorming and coffee-fueled design sprints.

## 💪 **Why This Matters**

Leading product design isn’t just about pretty interfaces—it’s about wrestling complex data problems to the ground while keeping users happy. These projects show how I:
- **Set the Vision**: Crafted clear charters that rallied teams like a battle cry.
- **Fostered Collaboration**: Got product, engineering, and marketing to sync up like a well-oiled machine.
- **Delivered Impact**: Built tools that solve real problems, from streamlining data flows to automating the boring stuff.

This folder is a testament to turning data chaos into elegant solutions, all while dodging the occasional flying wrench.
