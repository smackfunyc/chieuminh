# 💥 **AI & Product Design Portfolio:!** 💥

*WHAM!* Welcome to my **GitHub repository**,This is my curated showcase of **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **Product Design**, stuffed with **vetted, working projects** that I built while juggling TensorFlow scripts. You’ll also see my leadership in innovative products for **AI**, **data**, **anti-money laundering (AML)**, and **health-tech**.

---

## 🌀 **AI likes long walks on the beach...**

This repo is bouncing between **AI** and **product development**. Every project here is **battle-tested**

My **product design leadership** shines here too, where I’ve lead teams to build user-focused solutions in:
- **🤖 Artificial Intelligence**: Co-Pilot, Machine learning models and NLP apps that don’t short-circuit.
- **📊 Data Integration**: Pipelines, visualizations and Observability, Oh My!
- **🛡️ Anti-Money Laundering (AML)**: My inner geek as a superhero saving gotham from crooked bankers.
- **🩺 Health**: Apps that keep patients healthy and doctors honest.

> **💡 These projects are vetted and ready to roll**

---

## 📦 **What’s in the mixtape?**

- **🤖 AI Projects**: Scripts for scraping data, training models, and algorithmic trading bots.
- **🎨 Product Design Artifacts**: Case studies from leading teams through the circus of product development.
- **💰 Algo Trades**: Clean, documented, and tougher than a rubber chicken.
- **🪚 Wild Tools**: Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Tweepy, Thingy-ma-jigs, whatever I could find.

---

## 🎪 **So What?**

1. **Poke Around**: Sift through folders for AI scripts and design docs. Each project has a `README` to guide you, or not.
2. **Run the Code**: Follow the instructions to fire up scripts or eyeball design artifacts.
3. **Join the Chaos**: Read code comments and case studies to see how I dodged disaster, and pitch in if you want to lose a friend.

### How to pick up girls
- **[X Scraper](x_scraper/)**: A Python script that grabs Solana tweets with the X API v2, filters out the junk, and saves ‘em to a CSV.

## 💪 **Why I exist(this repo)**

This portfolio is my paper trail of **tackling gnarly problems** with tech, even if I occasionally slip on a stray data point. The **AI projects** prove I can engineer prompts for code without setting the tent on fire(except the first 7), and the **product design work** shows I can lead teams to build stuff companies use to make money, all while delighting users. Whether you’re into AI, data, AML, or battle rap, there’s something here for you, or not.
